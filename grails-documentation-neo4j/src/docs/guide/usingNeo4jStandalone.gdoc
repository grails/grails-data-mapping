If you plan to use Neo4j as your primary datastore then you need to remove the Hibernate plugin by editing your @BuildConfig@ or @build.gradle@ (dependending on the version of Grails) and removing the Hibernate plugin definition

With this done all domain classes in grails-app/domain will be persisted via Neo4j and not Hibernate. You can create a domain class by running the regular @create-domain-class@ command:

{code}
grails create-domain-class Person
{code}

The @Person@ domain class will automatically be a persistent entity that can be stored in Neo4j.
