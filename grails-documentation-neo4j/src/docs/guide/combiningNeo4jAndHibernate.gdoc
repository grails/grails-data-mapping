If you have both the Hibernate and Neo4j plugins installed then by default all classes in the @grails-app/domain@  directory will be persisted by Hibernate and not Neo4j. If you want to persist a particular domain class with Neo4j then you must use the @mapWith@ property in the domain class:

{code}
static mapWith = "neo4j"
{code}
