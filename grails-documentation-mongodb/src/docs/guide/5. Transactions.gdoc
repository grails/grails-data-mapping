MongoDB doesn't support transactions directly, however GORM for MongoDB does batch up inserts and updates until the session is flushed. This makes it possible to support some rollback options.

You can use either transactional services or the static @withTransaction@ method. To mark a service as using the MongoDB transaction manager, use the static @transactional@ property with the value @'mongo'@:

{code}
static transactional = 'mongo'
{code}

Alternately you can do ad-hoc transactions using the @withTransaction@ method:

{code}
Person.withTransaction { status ->
    new Person(name:"Bob", age:50).save()
    throw new RuntimeException("bad")
    new Person(name:"Fred", age:45).save()
}
{code}

For example in this case neither @Person@ object will be persisted to the database, because underneath the surface a persistence session is being used to batch up both insert operations into a single insert. When the exception is thrown neither insert is ever executed, hence we allow for some transactional semantics are the GORM-level.

Using the lower level API you can of course also take advantage of Mongo's support for [Atomic operations|http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/isolate-sequence-of-operations].
