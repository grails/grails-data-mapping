If you have both the Hibernate and Redis plugins installed then by default all classes in the @grails-app/domain@ directory will be persisted by Hibernate and not Redis. If you want to persist a particular domain class with Redis then you must use the @mapWith@ property in the domain class:

{code}
static mapWith = "redis"
{code}
