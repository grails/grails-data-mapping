The Riak plugin provides a Groovy mixin called [DatastoreUnitTestMixin|testing] for testing purposes. This mixin sets up a datastore implementation that operates against an in-memory @ConcurrentHashMap@. The datastore implementation that operates against an in-memory map is as complete as the one for Riak and provides support for:

* Simple persistence methods
* Dynamic finders
* Criteria
* Named queries
* Inheritance

You can easily write tests that use the mixin using Groovy's @Mixin@ annotation on any existing unit test:

{code}
import grails.datastore.test.DatastoreUnitTestMixin

@Mixin(DatastoreUnitTestMixin)
class PersonTests extends GroovyTestCase {
    void testPersist() {
        mockDomain(Person)
        def s = new Simple(name:"Bob")
        s.save()

        assert s.id != null

        s = Simple.get(s.id)

        assert s != null
    }

    void tearDown() {
        disconnect()
    }
}
{code}

You should call the @mockDomain()@ method to mock a domain instance and then the remainder of the API is the same. Note that you should call @disconnect()@ in @tearDown()@ otherwise your tests will share data.
